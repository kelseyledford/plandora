# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: "Chicago" }, { name: "Copenhagen" }])
#   Mayor.create(name: "Emanuel", city: cities.first)

# Theme.destroy_all

# Theme.create(name: "Camping")
# Theme.create(name: "Casino")
# Theme.create(name: "Europe")
# Theme.create(name: "Cruise")
# Theme.create(name: "Theme Park")
# Theme.create(name: "Road Trip")
# Theme.create(name: "Etc.")
